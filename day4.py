# for loop -> A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list,
#             tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each 
#             element in that sequence


# for i in range (11):
#     print(i*2)

# for i in range (5,15):
#     print(i)

# for i in range(5,15,2):
#     print(i)

# for i in range(15,5,1):
#     print(i)

#Table

# num = int(input("Enter a number to print table :"))

# for i in range(1,11):
#     print(num,"X",i,"=",num*i)


# start = int(input("Enter a number :"))
# end = int(input("Enter a number :"))

# for i in range(start,end):
#     if i%2==0:
#         print(i,"Even")
#     else:
#         print(i,"Odd")


# while loop -> A while loop repeatedlly executes a block of code as long as the
#               specified condition is true

# i = 1

# while i <=10:
#     print(i)
#     i+1

# while True:
#     print("Enter 0 to stop !")
#     choice = int(input("Enter a num (1-9) :"))
#     if choice == 0:
#         break
